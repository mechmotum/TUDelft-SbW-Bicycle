# Data Analysis
This folder contains the scripts used for data extraction, statistical analysis, graph plotting and file conversion from `.mat` to `.csv`.

`matlab_ext_plots` contains MATLAB scripts to convert `.mat` to `.csv`, extract performance measures, run a controller simulation, and plot time domain graphs.

`r_stats_figs` contains R scripts to run statistical analysis on the performance measures, and figure plotting.

## :warning: THIS FOLDER DOES NOT CONTAIN ANY DATA :warning:
Before running the scripts, data should be sourced and placed into `matlab_ext_plots/data/` (raw `.mat` data), or to `r_stats_figs/data/` (extracted performance data in `.csv`).
